# About me
  I'm a student at EPITECH Rennes in France.\
  I grew up with the internet and always thought it was fascinating but really misterious. But now i'm learning to make those fascinating things myself at school __AND__ on my free time.\
  Passionate about video games i did a Game jam at school on Unity and tried doing a few prototypes on godot Engine.\
  But i'm interested by all subjects regarding computers wich is why at school we learn about everything, from security to web, passing by software and hardware (wich i now know the difference 😁)

  At Epitech i am an Ambassador student, meaning i help during <ins>open days</ins>, <ins>coding clubs</ins>[^1] and many other events organized by the school and/or the students associations !

  [^1]: coding clubs are events when anyone can come to our school and learn how to code in different beginer-friendly languages on fun mini-projects
